Split of duties between Michael, Meara, Miguel: 
	Though we all worked together each group member "spear headed" portions
	of the project. Each group member was in charge of decisions regarding 
    error checking and user choice for that portion. Periodically we would go
    through as a group and coordinate to make sure our user interfaces were 
    cohesive. Every member participated in testing the user interface.

Issues that arose during creation:
	First issue that arose was using the timestamp variable. Initially 
	we tried to use java function to get and construct a timestamp variable. 
	Issues arose due to the constructor not allowed to be used in the 
	static way she wanted. We changed this using the SQL function now(). 
	This was much more successful. Due to changing how we did the original 
	timestamp we changed the destruction timestamp as well to use the now()
	function. This also made it more user friendly, because the user 
	was going to have to enter the timestamp in the correct format with 
	year-month-day hours:minutes:seconds. Creating a headache to verify 
	their input was in the correct format. Instead we used the +interval 
	function. No other large issues arose during creation. 
	
Assumptions made due to the non-specificness of the specs: 
	~ We assume that when a user views thier contact list they also want to 
		view there "friends" statuses at the same time. 
	~ We assume that when a user will only choose to set a self destruction 
		in a period of days. We chose days so that the user could pick a 
		large time period time 365 days but also allow a short time period
		like a day. 
	~ We assume that users may want to send themselves messages
    ~ We assume that notifications will delete as soon as you view notifications
        because users should read them as they view them. 
    ~ We assume users must follow through in their actions especially when they 
        choose to send a message.
